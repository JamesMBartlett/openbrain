Functional Neural Networks
===========================
* Classifying Data from Continuous Sampled Prcesses is IMPORTANT
    * Classifying speech
    * Classifying time-series data (stock market prices, earth quake tremors, etc)
* The problem is: MORE SAMPLES => SLOWER LEARNING
* Functional Neural Networks help solve this:
    * Shot in the dark: What if we had many neurons, then input quality wouldn;t be an issue!
    * Goal: make the notion of computing with infiniteley many neurons a possibility.
    * This would allow any quality of input without slowing learning significantly!
    * We did it! How? Math. Currently submitted to ICML,
        => but there is still so much we could do with this algorithm
         * theoretically
         * and applications!

    * Research in Machine Learning is hard to approach without joining a Lab!
    * Joining a lab funnels you into a limited niche of research
    * This is great but,
        * Doesn't give opportunity to explore your own ideas
        * Which is bad s
            many of the great advacnes in science
            = completely out of left field.
